# Keto Software Group Project
This project was created as apart of the Software Projects module for the second year of the Computer Science course at Goldsmiths, University of London. 

Working in a team of four, we had to come up with a concept which aims to tackle some sort of issue of our choice. Using HTML, CSS, and languages such as PHP, JavaScript, MySQL, we were successfully able to create a dynamic web application called Ketogenetics. Ketogenetics is a web application that used to help new and existing followers of the keto diet to track macros, monitor their water intake and much more.

Over an academic year, we were continuously meeting up with our supevisor, discussing the code, and working in separate teams of front-end and back-end.
